This document is a final report constructed using the IEEEtran style guidelines. The report provides an introduction to our senior project, a project description, and a personal overview from each member of the team about what they learned over the course of the project. The report includes our original requirements document, design document, and technological review with an added discussion about each document. This discussion describes how the project has changed over the course of the year in comparison to how it was perceived during the planning process. Also included is our weekly blog posts that were been generated over the course of the year to keep our TA and our sponsors up to date with our progress. We also included our final poster that was used at the Engineering Expo. Appendix A covers essential code listings and Appendix B displays the hardware we used and a few output images from our vision system.
