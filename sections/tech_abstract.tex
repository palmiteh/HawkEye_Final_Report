The goal of this project is to create a proof of concept for a low cost real time video processor system for airborne vehicles. This system will combine multiple camera views into one complete picture for remote display on both manned and unmanned commercial and military aircraft. It should be low cost, low power, lightweight, and the code base should be easy to maintain and improve. Rockwell Collins currently develops and manufactures avionic camera systems with integrated video processors. These systems are extremely high performance, but modifications and improvements to the systems are extremely difficult to implement and require a substantial amount of time and money to develop. Therefore our project will be a proof of concept to explore alternative technologies that may be able to provide similar performance, while reducing development and hardware costs.
