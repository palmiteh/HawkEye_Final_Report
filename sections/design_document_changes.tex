\subsection{Overall Description Changes}
We ended up having a physical copy of the performance of the system at expo instead of working it into our software. This was because we were advised that using the software to measure its own performance would lead to problems, leading us to measure the performance of the system using a high speed camera which can't be done automatically.
\subsection{Specific Requirements}
One of the goals of the original design document was to create requirements that were reasonably achievable. Because of this mindset, the requirements in the document did not change very much. We had to adjust the design to accomidate no less than two cameras and scrap the possibility of using the TK1 and focus solely on the TX1.
\subsection{Information Viewpoint}
We had originally intended to create a modular Json system, but scrapped it later on because it wasn't very valuable and created unecessary complexity. In place on the Json system, we have a small object oriented C++ API that allows for the creation and linking of cameras and filters.
