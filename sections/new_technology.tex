The primary resource used for this project was the CUDA 7.0 User manual, found on NVIDIA?s website. This manual contains a best practices guide which explains how to use various optimizations and produce code that best takes advantage of the GPU hardware. \\
\parThe edge detection algorithm we used is an adaptation of the LSD Line Segment Detector, which was originally developed as a graduate research project. The original research article can be found at http://www.ipol.im/pub/art/2012/gjmr-lsd/.\\
\parLastly we made use of various documentation from Point Grey, which described how to set up the cameras, alter various settings, and determine the appropriate Bayer conversion mode (there are multiple different input types). Their website is www.ptgrey.com.\\
